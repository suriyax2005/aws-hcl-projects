# Assignment 13 – Daily Sales Reporting Pipeline Using Apache Airflow and PySpark

## 1. Project Overview

This project implements an automated daily sales reporting pipeline using **Apache Airflow and Apache Spark (PySpark)**.

The pipeline simulates overnight batch ingestion of sales data, processes the data using Spark transformations, calculates important business metrics, and stores the final report in a presentation layer.

Apache Airflow is responsible for orchestrating and scheduling the workflow, while Apache Spark performs distributed data processing.

## 2. Objectives

- Simulate batch ingestion using static overnight sales CSV data.
- Separate storage layers from compute processing.
- Orchestrate the workflow using Apache Airflow.
- Use PySpark to transform and aggregate sales data.
- Calculate total sales and average order value.
- Demonstrate Spark lazy evaluation using execution-plan analysis.
- Store the processed output in the presentation layer.
- Configure a daily scheduled workflow.

## 6. Pipeline Workflow

### Step 1 – Batch Ingestion

The pipeline uses a static CSV file named `overnight_sales.csv` to simulate overnight sales data ingestion.

The file is stored in the staging layer.

### Step 2 – Workflow Orchestration

Apache Airflow manages the workflow through a DAG named:

`daily_sales_reporting`

The workflow is configured with a daily schedule using:

```python
schedule="@daily"
```

The `DockerOperator` launches a Spark container to execute the processing script.

### Step 3 – Data Transformation

The PySpark script reads the staging CSV file and calculates order-level sales.

**Order Sales Formula:**

```text
Order Sales = Quantity × Unit Price
```

### Step 4 – Business Metrics Calculation

The pipeline calculates:

**Total Sales**

```text
Total Sales = SUM(Order Sales)
```

**Average Order Value**

```text
Average Order Value = Total Sales / Total Orders
```

**Total Orders**

```text
Total Orders = COUNT(Order ID)
```

### Step 5 – Presentation Layer

The calculated metrics are written to the presentation layer in CSV format.

Spark generates a CSV output directory containing a data part file and a `_SUCCESS` marker.

## 7. Demonstrating Lazy Evaluation in Spark

Apache Spark uses lazy evaluation. Transformations are not immediately executed when they are defined.

In this project, the following transformations are created:

```python
orders_df = sales_df.withColumn(
    "order_sales",
    col("quantity") * col("unit_price")
)
```

The execution plan is examined using:

```python
orders_df.explain(mode="formatted")
```

This allows us to inspect the planned execution before triggering an action.

Execution is triggered using actions such as:

```python
metrics_df.show(truncate=False)
```

and:

```python
metrics_df.write.csv(output_path)
```

**Key concept:** Transformations build the execution plan, while actions trigger Spark computation.

## 8. Running the Project

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running.
- Apache Airflow configured through Docker Compose.
- Apache Spark Docker image available.
- Python and PySpark processing script.

### Start Airflow

From the project directory:

```powershell

Open the Airflow dashboard:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

### Monitor the DAG

1. Open the Airflow dashboard.
2. Locate `daily_sales_reporting`.
3. Enable the DAG if it is paused.
4. Trigger a manual run if required.
5. Monitor the `process_sales_data` task.
6. Verify that the task completes successfully.

### Verify the Output

```powershell
Get-ChildItem .\presentation\daily_sales_report
```

Read the generated CSV:

```powershell
Get-Content .\presentation\daily_sales_report\part-*.csv
```
